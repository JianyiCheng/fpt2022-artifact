# FPT 2022 Artifact

This is the code artifact for the FPT 2022 paper: Area-Efficient Memory Scheduling for Dynamically Scheduled High-Level Synthesis

To reproduce the result, we strongly suggest you to use our pre-installed VM to try it out. Please contact `jianyi.cheng17@imperial.ac.uk` for access.

In the VM, to reproduce all the experiment:
```
run-experiments
```
This could take hours (~8 hours for 8 cores and 32GB RAM).
To view the results:
```
view-results
```
A table will be displayed in console.

Our source code has already been built in the VM. To rebuild from source:
```
build-from-source
```
This could take hours (~4 hours for 8 cores and 32GB RAM).

To cite our work, please use the following bib:
